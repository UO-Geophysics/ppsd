- ftcs.py : contains all the fonctions used in the scripts

- plot_signal.py : uses some fonctions of the obspy package to plot the raw seismic data

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

- spec_estimation_*.py : use of obspy to plot the PPSD as presented in the package. _comp is made for the comparison of 2 sets of data, _yr is for several days of data up to a year

- spec_estimation_plot_*.py : same characteristics as the one before. these scripts provide a variant with curves instead of the spectral form, with each curve representing the highest probability for each frequency bin

In the "old" folder because these scripts compute on raw data without any sorting of spurious signals (could be earthquakes).

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

- eq_tri_plot_*py : PPSD with curves (same as spec_estimation_*py) but any spurious signals and so possible earthquakes are sorted out using a CNN. can be launch on a local computer, or for UO people on the cluster with talapas version (more recent ones)

These scripts are intended to study 4 hours of data, need to make the change if more are needed.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

- param.json : gives the parameters of the stations we choose to study (talapas version with arguments)

All files in the "files" folder need to be in the same folder as the launched script.
